With over 20 years of dedicated service in the public sector, I bring a strong foundation in problem-solving and effective communication to the table. My journey in technology began in the late 1980s when I wrote my first computer program on a Tandy computer, sparking a lasting passion for the field.

Throughout my career, I’ve focused on helping others while navigating complex issues in law and policy. My extensive experience in customer service has honed my skills in evaluating challenges, resolving problems, and supporting colleagues in achieving their goals. I thrive in dynamic environments, consistently delivering results and meeting tight deadlines.

As I embark on this exciting new chapter, I am eager to combine my public service background with my passion for data analysis and technology. This transition allows me to leverage my skills in data-driven solutions to make a meaningful impact.
